    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Recently, my research has clustered in three main areas.</p>

    <div class="research-area">
        <p class="area-label">I. Explanation and Why-Questions</p>
        <p>The first centers around the fact that explanations are answers to why questions. This area has proven to be an interesting intersection of philosophy of science and metaphysics (on the explanation side), which I studied during my MPhil at La Sorbonne, and language and cognitive science (on the why-questions side), which I am currently studying at the ENS. So far, most of the talks I've given in this area center around the semantics of explanation and why-questions—and some implications of the semantics for the metaphysics of time and for AI.</p>

    <div class="research-area">
        <p class="area-label">II. Philosophy of Computational Neuroscience and AI</p>
        <p>A second interest of mine involves general questions about the philosophy of computational neuroscience and AI. For instance, I have some thoughts about inferring things about the computational structure of mind from empirical data about brain-model alignment.</p>

    <div class="research-area">
        <p class="area-label">III. Meaning Beyond Language</p>
        <p>My third main interest is a bit broader, and has to do with the following question: <em>How, generally speaking, can things have meaning?</em> This interest involves exploring how non-linguistic tokens—such as fashion tokens or non-verbal actions—communicate meaning and inhere content. So far, this has taken the form of figuring out how fashion inheres meaning and communicates. This research has paired nicely with my more dilettantish interests in fashion and in music (see varia).</p>
